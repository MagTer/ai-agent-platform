# Documentation Style

- Encoding: UTF-8.
- Language: Swedish for user-facing text; code/config in English.
- Avoid emojis and “smart” punctuation. Use ASCII-safe punctuation (e.g., `->`, `--`, quotes `'"`).
- Keep examples copy/pasteable across Windows/WSL/Linux.
- Prefer plain lists and short sections; avoid decorative symbols.

PowerShell scripts remain ASCII-only.
