# Continuous Integration

CI is provided by a single GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
The workflow executes on every push and pull request targeting `main`.

## Jobs

1. **Lint**
   - Installs dependencies with `poetry install --no-interaction`.
   - Runs `poetry run ruff check .`.
2. **Test**
   - Reuses the Poetry installation from the lint job via the actions cache.
   - Executes `poetry run pytest -v`.

Both jobs run on `ubuntu-latest`. Failing lint or test steps block merges.

## Local Validation

Before pushing, run:

```
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run pytest -v
```

For formatting parity, also run `poetry run black .` locally even though the
workflow only enforces linting. This keeps CI fast while preserving formatting
standards.
