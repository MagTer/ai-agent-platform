# n8n Workflows

This directory contains exported n8n workflows for the agent platform.

## Sync workflows

Use the PowerShell script `scripts/N8N-Workflows.ps1` to backup/restore workflows from the running n8n instance:

```powershell
# Export all workflows from container to repo
./scripts/N8N-Workflows.ps1 export

# Import workflows from repo into a (clean) n8n instance
./scripts/N8N-Workflows.ps1 import

# Include credentials (stored in flows/credentials.json)
./scripts/N8N-Workflows.ps1 export -IncludeCredentials
./scripts/N8N-Workflows.ps1 import -IncludeCredentials
```

- `flows/workflows/` contains one JSON per workflow (auto-generated by export).
- `flows/workflows.json` aggregates all workflows as a reference.

> Edit workflows directly in the n8n UI, then run `export` so git stays in sync.

### Credentials policy

- Credentials are excluded from the repo by default (`flows/credentials.json` is gitignored).
- Only include credentials with the explicit `-IncludeCredentials` flag and commit with care. Prefer environment-based secrets or n8nâ€™s encrypted store for sensitive values.

## Workflow: Agent Echo

- File: `flows/workflows/agent-echo--1.json`
- Webhook: `POST /webhook/agent`
- Purpose: Acknowledges incoming `agent.echo` and returns the received args with timestamp.
